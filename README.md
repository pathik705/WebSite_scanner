# WebSite_scanner
A lightweight, educational Web Vulnerability Scanner built with Flask. It crawls within scope, probes for common issues (SQLi, XSS, missing headers, insecure cookies, clickjacking, permissive methods), assesses non-intrusive DDoS posture, shows real-time progress, and exports results to JSON/TXT/PDF.
